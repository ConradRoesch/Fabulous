**Why they choose Fabulous?**

Tawasal team was looking for cross platform solution that was stable & supported. When we started looking into what Xamarin has to offer, we came across Fabulous - and due to usage of modern & reactive MVU pattern, as well as the ability to build basically anything using native Xamarin.iOS / Xamarin.Android bindings (using less code & functional approach with F#), while still maintaining a large shared codebase our choice was surely Fabulous.
