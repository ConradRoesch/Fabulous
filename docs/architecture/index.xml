In order to manage and optimize the time of everyone involved, more reasonable goals are required to get a version 2 out as fast as possible.
Doing a complete redesign of the architecture + adding .NET 6 / MAUI support at the same time feels really discouraging.

When scrolling, the no longer visible rows are reused and updated with the new data.
In Xamarin.Forms, this is done via 2 controls: ListView and CollectionView. Also those controls support grouping data and displaying a group header/footer.
My main idea was to let the user pass in its data source and declare a template function (as well as 2 others for header/footer).</description></item></channel></rss>
